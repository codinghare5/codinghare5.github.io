            <b>About Me</b>
            <p>
                I was born in Poland in a small town called Pisz (Masurian Lake District, The district had been elected
                as one of the 28 finalists of the New 7 Wonders of Nature) and
                moved to West Yorkshire (as beautiful) in 2015 where I’ve mostly
                worked as a warehouse operative in few places around Leeds.
            </p>
            <p>
                During that period, in my free time, I’ve started learning to program in C# (Unity 3D) and last two
                years spent learning python and really fallen in love with the language (like many others).
                I’ve learned a lot from many YT videos and the <a href="https://realpython.com/">realpython.com</a>

            <b>Life during lockdown</b>
            <p>
                Like many people, I’ve tried to make the best of lockdown by taking the opportunity to learn some new
                skills. Here are some of the things that I’ve been doing:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Cooking
                </li>
                <li>
                    Learning React.js
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reading about Microservices Architecture (Apatche Kafka, joined their slack channel recently).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gaming
                </li>
                <li>
                    I helped few beginners with their code at stackoverflow in Python (threading, image manipulation,
                    shortening the code)
                </li>
                <li>
                    I have taken a break from Python in order to learn some front-end skills on the greatly usable
